	<p><I’m an ongoing student with The Open University, studying BSc (Honours) Computing and IT 
	in the last year of study looking to moving in a job sector that utilises the skills I have 
	developed in the first two years of university study mixed with previous work experience, to 
	further my ambition of being a software developer or website developer in a fast-paced and challenging 
	environment. Able to work independently and within a team to complete assignments or problem solve. 
	I have experience in using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Python and Java. 
	My eventual career goal is to become a website/software developer fluent in several languages and having 
	strong designing skills being involved in the process of development to actively contribute to the overall 
	success of any business I work for.</p>
